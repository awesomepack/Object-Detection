# Object-Detection
An application that receives a user's target object and image and returns a processed image with the user's object higlighted if present.

## Image Database
* Look into Image Datasets , preferably API's that can be called to provide training images

## Storage
* Determine the best way to store a dataset of image files for computer vision

## Image pre-processing
* apply paradigm pre-processing techniques on training data

## Training
* Train an object detection algorithm using processed images

## Web application
* Create a web page that requests user for target object and image
* This information will be used to generate a dataset of relevant images for the model to be trained on
* The web app will return the target image with the target objects that were found within it on the web page.
